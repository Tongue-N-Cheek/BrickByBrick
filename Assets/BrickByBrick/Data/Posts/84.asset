    comment: Despite what conflicting feelings you may have about the current state
      of the nation it is important to remember that it is the people who make it
      up and not the government. They want you to fight their wars for them when
      your true responsibility is to your communities. Organize mutual aid and build
      close connections. Become self sustaining. I believe in you.
